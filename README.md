# üõ°Ô∏è Dual-Defence

*A Journey Through Code and Combat*

## About This Project

Dual-Defence (also known as Stick Defend) represents our first major coding adventure - a tower defense game born from curiosity, countless debugging sessions, and the excitement of bringing our ideas to life. Built with Python and Pygame, this project showcases what passionate first-year programming students can create when they put their minds to it.

What started as a simple learning exercise evolved into a comprehensive gaming experience featuring two distinct game modes, complete user management, and an engaging progression system. Every line of code tells the story of our growth as developers.
